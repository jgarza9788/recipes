# Other Marinades
## Chinese
* Sesame oil  
This recipe is more Asian specialized so we recommend sesame oil over an olive oil.

* Rice Wine Vinegar  
Again any vinegar will work, we just find rice wine to have a very neutral flavor that works well in this dish.

* Spices  
Salt,  
pepper,  
garlic powder,  
and Chinese 5 spice.
and maybe soy sauce 

## Tandoori
* Plain Greek Yoghurt  
We searched for the lowest carb yoghurt possible to ensure we were still getting our desired flavor without breaking our diet bank.

* Lemon Juice  
This is going to be the acid in our recipe. Lemon juice is fresh and poppy which is great for setting off the yoghurt sauce.

* Spices  
Garam Masala,  
cayenne,  
paprika,  
sea salt,  
turmeric,  
and cumin.
