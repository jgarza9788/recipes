# INGREDIENTS:
Guideline: Any fruit at any amount. 

## Basic sugar to fruit ratio is:
* 1/4 (52g) cup-2/3 cup (136g) granulated sugar per pound (450g) of fruit 
* 1/2 teaspoon (2ml) acid per pound of fruit (lemon, vinegar, other citrus juice)
 
# INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Peel fruit then cut into small pieces. Toss in sugar, leave for 1-2 hours or overnight in the fridge wrapped in plastic to macerate. Start at 52g sugar per pound of fruit. Add more after the macerating process if necessary.
2. *Simmering time will vary based on the amount of fruit used. For 1 pound of fruit expect it to take around 15-20 minutes.

Optional for raspberries: Â½ cup (104g) sugar for every pound of fruit. 

3. Put macerated fruit in pot, add 2 tbsps of acid to activate pectin, the chemical that activates the thickening of fruit. 
4. Cool in a metal bowl and ice bath set up. 
5. OPTIONAL: Strain seedy berry jams through sieve or chinois if needed 
6. Store and use as needed.
