Japanese Rice

* Japanese short-grain rice (e.g. Koshihikari or Calrose)
* Water (filtered preferred)
* Optional: Kombu (a 2-inch square piece for umami boost)

1. Rinse the rice
   * Add rice to a bowl, fill with water, swirl gently with hand
   * Drain and repeat 4–5 times until water is mostly clear
   * Let drained rice sit for 15–30 minutes to absorb surface moisture

2. Cook in Instant Pot
   * 1:1 ratio of rinsed rice to water (e.g., 1 cup rice : 1 cup water)
   * Add optional kombu on top
   * Set Instant Pot to **Low Pressure** for **12 minutes**
   * Natural release for **10 minutes**, then quick release

3. Rest and fluff
   * Remove kombu (if used)
   * Let rice sit with lid off for 5–10 minutes
   * Fluff gently with rice paddle

## suggestions
* Use a rice paddle or silicone spatula to avoid crushing the grains
* Best texture comes from low pressure and natural release
* Scale recipe up, but keep the 1:1 water ratio
