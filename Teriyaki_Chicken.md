1. **Dice the chicken** (breast or thigh meat works best).
2. **Marinate** in teriyaki sauce (15–30 min for flavor, or skip if in a rush).
3. **Cook in a pan** over medium-high heat until browned and cooked through (internal temp: 165°F / 74°C). Stir occasionally.
4. (Optional) **Add extra sauce** toward the end and simmer until slightly thickened and glossy.

### 📝 Tips

* Don’t overcrowd the pan — cook in batches if needed.
* Use a little oil to prevent sticking.
* If your teriyaki sauce is high in sugar, watch for burning.
