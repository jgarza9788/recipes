🍗 Oven-Baked Teriyaki Chicken Bites
Ingredients:
* Diced chicken (breast or thigh)
* Teriyaki sauce (store-bought or homemade)

Instructions:
1.Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
2.Toss chicken with teriyaki sauce in a bowl.
3.Spread on a baking sheet lined with parchment or foil (optional: use a wire rack for crispier edges).
4.Bake for 18–22 minutes, flipping halfway through, until the chicken reaches 165°F (74°C).
5.(Optional) Broil for 1–2 minutes at the end for caramelized edges.

Tips:
Don’t drown the chicken in sauce or it’ll steam instead of roast.
Add veggies (like broccoli or bell peppers) to the sheet for a one-pan meal.
